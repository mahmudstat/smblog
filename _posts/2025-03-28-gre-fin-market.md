Read the text to practice your **GRE vocabulary**. The words essential for the **GRE** are in bold.

Financial markets, often regarded as **inviolable** pillars of economic stability, are in fact **mercurial** entities, prone to **vicissitudes** that can unnerve even the most **prescient** investors. While analysts may craft **sophistic** models that claim to predict market behavior, history has shown that speculative fervor can be **inimical** to rational decision-making, leading to **precipitous** collapses.

One need only examine the **vaunted** financial institutions of the early 2000s, whose **largesse** and unchecked risk-taking culminated in a **recondite** network of bad debts. Their executives, once **lionized** for their financial acumen, were later **pilloried** for their role in the economic downturn. Governments, often reluctant to intervene, were ultimately forced to enact **palliative** measures to mitigate the **moribund** state of global finance.

Yet, despite the **ossified** belief in market self-correction, many regulatory efforts remain **desultory** and **myopic**, failing to address underlying systemic risks. Some critics argue that the relentless pursuit of profit fosters a **profligate** culture, where short-term gains are prioritized over **salutary** economic policies. Meanwhile, others contend that increased oversight could prove **countermanding**, stifling innovation and entrepreneurship.

Thus, the question remains: can financial markets ever be truly stable, or is their inherent **turbulence** an unavoidable consequence of human ambition and folly? As history suggests, any assumption of perpetual stability is not only **fatuous** but also **deleterious**, for it is often in moments of hubris that the most **tumultuous** collapses occur.
