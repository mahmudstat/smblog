### Set 01

**The Impact of Artificial Light on Sleep**

Exposure to artificial light, particularly blue light emitted from electronic devices like smartphones and tablets, can significantly disrupt the human body's natural sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. This disruption occurs because blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. While natural sunlight also contains blue light, our exposure to it is typically during the day, which helps to keep our circadian rhythm aligned with the day-night cycle. However, the widespread use of electronic devices in the evening exposes us to high levels of blue light at a time when our bodies are preparing for rest. Some studies suggest that prolonged exposure to artificial light at night can not only lead to difficulty falling asleep and reduced sleep quality but may also have longer-term health implications.

**Statements:**

Decide whether the following statements are **True**, **False**, or **Not Given** based on the information in the text.

1.  The circadian rhythm is solely controlled by exposure to blue light.
2.  Melatonin production is increased by exposure to blue light.
3.  Natural sunlight helps to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle.
4.  The text mentions specific long-term health problems caused by artificial light at night.
5.  Smartphones and tablets are the only sources of artificial blue light.
6.  Exposure to natural blue light in the evening is beneficial for sleep.

### Set 02

**Coffee consumption**

Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, enjoyed by millions for its stimulating effects and distinctive flavor. The primary active compound in coffee is caffeine, a natural stimulant that can enhance alertness and improve focus. Studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of certain health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. However, excessive intake of caffeine can lead to negative side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, and increased heart rate. The effects of coffee can also vary depending on individual factors such as metabolism and sensitivity to caffeine. While some research suggests a potential link between very high coffee consumption and certain health risks, the overwhelming scientific consensus points to moderate consumption being generally safe for most adults.

**Statements:**

Decide whether the following statements are **True**, **False**, or **Not Given** based on the information in the text.

1.  Tea is more widely consumed globally than coffee.
2.  Caffeine is the only active compound present in coffee.
3.  Drinking a moderate amount of coffee has been linked to a lower chance of developing some illnesses.
4.  Increased heart rate is a guaranteed outcome of drinking coffee.
5.  Individual responses to coffee are consistent across all people.
6.  The majority of scientific opinion indicates that drinking a lot of coffee is beneficial for health.
