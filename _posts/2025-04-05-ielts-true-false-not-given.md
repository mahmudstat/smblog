### Set 01

**The Impact of Artificial Light on Sleep**

Exposure to artificial light, particularly blue light emitted from electronic devices like smartphones and tablets, can significantly disrupt the human body's natural sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. This disruption occurs because blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. While natural sunlight also contains blue light, our exposure to it is typically during the day, which helps to keep our circadian rhythm aligned with the day-night cycle. However, the widespread use of electronic devices in the evening exposes us to high levels of blue light at a time when our bodies are preparing for rest. Some studies suggest that prolonged exposure to artificial light at night can not only lead to difficulty falling asleep and reduced sleep quality but may also have longer-term health implications.

**Statements:**

Decide whether the following statements are **True**, **False**, or **Not Given** based on the information in the text.

1.  The circadian rhythm is solely controlled by exposure to blue light.
2.  Melatonin production is increased by exposure to blue light.
3.  Natural sunlight helps to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle.
4.  The text mentions specific long-term health problems caused by artificial light at night.
5.  Smartphones and tablets are the only sources of artificial blue light.
6.  Exposure to natural blue light in the evening is beneficial for sleep.
