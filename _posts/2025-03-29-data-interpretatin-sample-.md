### Interpretation 1

The table illustrates the sales revenue (in million dollars) generated by three smartphone brands—Echo, Vivo, and Lumia—across four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Overall, Asia emerges as the most lucrative market, while Australia records the lowest sales figures. Among the three brands, Vivo consistently leads in all regions, whereas Echo generates the least revenue in every market.

Asia contributes the highest revenue for all brands, with Vivo achieving the peak sales figure of $80 million, followed by Lumia at $75 million and Echo at $70 million. North America ranks second, with sales figures trailing 20 million dollars behind those in Asia across all brands. Europe follows closely, generating revenues 5 to 10 million dollars lower than North America.

In contrast, Australia is the weakest market, where sales figures are notably lower across all brands. The revenue difference between brands is minimal in this region, ranging only from $30 million (Echo) to $35 million (Vivo), making it the market with the narrowest sales gap. Meanwhile, the largest revenue disparity is seen in Asia, where Vivo outperforms Echo by a significant $10 million.

In summary, the data highlights Asia as the dominant revenue source for all three brands, while Australia remains the least profitable market with the smallest variation in sales figures.
