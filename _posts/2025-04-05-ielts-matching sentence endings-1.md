Here is a sample IELTS Matching Sentence Endings question based on a short text about the history of the bicycle.

**Text:**

The bicycle, now a ubiquitous mode of transport and recreation, has a fascinating history marked by numerous innovations and evolving designs. The earliest forms of personal wheeled transport, such as the "velocipede" of the late 18th century, **were propelled by the rider pushing their feet against the ground.** This proved to be inefficient and uncomfortable, leading to a desire for a more effective means of propulsion.

The first true "bicycle," featuring a rotary crank mechanism and pedals attached to the front wheel, **emerged in the early 19th century, attributed to the work of Baron Karl von Drais in Germany.** This "Draisienne" or "hobby-horse" still lacked pedals on the rear wheel and had a fixed front wheel, making steering challenging.

Further developments throughout the 19th century saw the introduction of the "penny-farthing," characterized by its large front wheel and small rear wheel. This design **allowed for greater speed due to the larger circumference of the driving wheel.** However, it was also inherently unstable and dangerous.

The "safety bicycle," with its wheels of equal size, a rear-wheel chain drive, and pneumatic tires, **revolutionized cycling and made it accessible to a wider population.** This design, which appeared in the late 19th century, forms the basis of the modern bicycle we know today.
