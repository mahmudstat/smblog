The table illustrates the average monthly electricity consumption (in kWh) across four cities—New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney—for three types of households: apartments, townhouses, and detached houses.

London has the highest consumption in townhouses, peaking at 600 kWh, while it also records the highest consumption for detached houses. In contrast, New York shows the lowest consumption for townhouses, with just 210 kWh. Tokyo stands out with detached houses generating the least consumption, whereas in the other cities, these homes typically account for the highest or second-highest electricity consumption.

Apartment homes consistently produce the smallest consumption figures across all cities, with consumption varying between 300 kWh and 460 kWh. The variation is significantly greater in the townhouse category, where the values range from 210 kWh to 600 kWh.

In summary, detached houses are typically the largest consumers of electricity, with the notable exception of Tokyo, where apartments lead in consumption.
