**The Rise of Urban Farming**

Urban farming, the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around urban areas, has gained significant traction in recent years. This trend is driven by a variety of factors and manifests in several distinct forms.

**A. Community Gardens:** These are typically plots of land, often publicly owned or made available by local authorities, that are divided into smaller individual or group gardens. Participants cultivate their own produce, fostering a sense of community and providing access to fresh, locally grown food.

**B. Rooftop Gardens:** Utilizing the underutilized space on building rooftops, these gardens can range from small-scale personal projects to large commercial operations. They offer benefits such as reduced building energy consumption through insulation and mitigation of the urban heat island effect.

**C. Vertical Farms:** These innovative systems involve growing crops in vertically stacked layers within controlled indoor environments. This method maximizes space efficiency and allows for year-round production, independent of weather conditions.

**D. Edible Landscaping:** This approach integrates fruit-bearing trees, shrubs, and vegetables into existing ornamental landscapes in public and private spaces. The aim is to create aesthetically pleasing environments that also provide edible produce.
