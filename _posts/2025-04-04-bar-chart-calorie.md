## Interpretation 1

The graph illustrates the average daily calorie intake from four food categories—grains, protein, vegetables, and dairy—across four nations: the USA, Italy, India, and Japan.

A prominent feature is the disparity in primary calorie sources among these countries. In the USA, vegetables constitute the highest intake, whereas dairy predominates in Italy, protein in India, and grains in Japan. Notably, India displays the lowest overall calorie consumption, with both grain and dairy intakes falling below 250 calories and no category exceeding 1000 calories.

Vegetables maintain a consistently high consumption rate across all nations, ranking as the primary source in the USA and the second most significant in the other three. Grains and protein exhibit a variable pattern, each representing the primary calorie source in one nation and ranking second or third in the others. Conversely, dairy consumption presents the most dramatic variation, ranging from approximately 200 calories in India to nearly 1100 calories in Italy. In comparison, vegetable calorie intake fluctuates within a narrower range, from 600 to 1000 calories.

Overall, the graph reveals substantial differences in dietary patterns, with vegetable intake remaining relatively stable while other food categories demonstrate significant regional variations. The total calorie intake also varies greatly, with Italy having the highest and India having the lowest.

## Interpretation 2

The bar chart illustrates the average daily calorie intake from four food types—grains, protein, vegetables, and dairy—across four countries: the USA, Italy, India, and Japan.

Overall, grains are the dominant source of calories in most countries, particularly in India and Japan, while dairy contributes significantly only in Italy. Vegetables and protein show moderately high consumption in most regions.

In the USA, grains account for the highest intake, at approximately 1300 calories, followed by protein (700 cal) and vegetables (600 cal). Italy, in contrast, records the highest dairy intake at nearly 1100 calories, with grains and vegetables contributing 1200 and 1000 calories, respectively.

India consumes the most grains (1500 cal), with significantly lower values for protein (400 cal) and dairy (200 cal). Vegetables remain moderate at 500 calories. Japan presents a more balanced profile, with grain intake around 1100 calories, vegetables at 600, protein at 550, and dairy at 250 calories.

In summary, grains dominate the diet in most countries except Italy, where dairy leads, while India and Japan rely least on dairy products.
